<a href=\"https://noc.social/@bgp4\">@bgp4@noc.social</a> \
and the <a href=\"https://noc.social/@bgp6\">@bgp6@noc.social</a> in Mastodon \
and reposting every toot from there. As result you see some statistics about the Internet BGP table state, \
which is collected by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@mellowd\">Darren O'Connor</a>, \
these Mastodon bots creator.\n\n\
Please go to the /settings menu, where you can setup which BGP table state v4 or v6 you would like to see. \
The /start command subscribes you to all updates and the /stop unsubscribes and mutes.\n\n\
Updates are sent to you as fast as they appear in the original Mastodon bots, usually every 6 hours. \
The command /status sends the last posted status to the stream.\n\n\
My author @UrgentPirate open for questions and proposals. \
My code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/Urlandi/BGPTable_tw2tg/issues\">GitHub.</a>"
